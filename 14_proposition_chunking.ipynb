      "**Accuracy:**\n",
      "The chunk-based retrieval response is more accurate, as it provides a comprehensive list of 7 main ethical concerns in AI development, which are supported by various sources. In contrast, the proposition-based retrieval response only mentions 2 concerns, which are also relevant but do not cover the full range of issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relevance:**\n",
      "Both responses are relevant to the query, but the chunk-based retrieval response is more comprehensive, addressing a broader range of concerns. The proposition-based retrieval response provides a good overview of the main concerns, but it does not delve as deeply into the specific issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conciseness:**\n",
      "The proposition-based retrieval response is more concise, as it provides a clear and concise summary of the main concerns. The chunk-based retrieval response is more verbose, but it provides a more detailed and comprehensive overview of the issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clarity:**\n",
      "The proposition-based retrieval response is clearer, as it uses simple and straightforward language to convey the main concerns. The chunk-based retrieval response uses more technical terms and concepts, which may make it less accessible to non-experts.\n",

      "**Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Proposition-Based Retrieval:**\n",
